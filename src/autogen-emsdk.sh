# We use gnu automake to build.  I've tried to make the contents of the
# repository as platform agnostic as possible, so you'll need to call
# autoreconf before configure.

# Make m4 directory, otherwise autoreconf fails when it doesn't exist.
mkdir -p m4

autoreconf --install --verbose

# The following sequence is are the manual steps if autoreconf isn't available.
#
#aclocal $ACLOCAL_FLAGS
#glibtoolize
#autoheader
#autoconf
#automake -a --add-missing


# Configure.
emconfigure ./configure

# Instead, use this line if building for SWIG Java:
# ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DUSE_ASSERT_EXCEPTIONS"

# Instead, use this line if building for SWIG Python:
# ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3 -DNDEBUG -arch x86_64 -arch i386" LDFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch i386"

emmake make

# The following builds examples and tests for each of the libraries.
# Please look at these before sending me questions.
emmake make check
